# NZX
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple tool for scraping the NZX website for the publicly released data on stock prices.

## Legal Restrictions
I take no responsibility for any actions you take when implementing this code, including but not limited to:
* Breaking NZX terms of service.
* Suffering financially.

## Data Accuracy
This data should not be relied upon for time sensitive applications as it is limited by:
* The frequency data is pulled.
* The restrictions the NZX chooses to place on their free, publicly available data.
